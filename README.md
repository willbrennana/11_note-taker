# Note Taker

This was my first challenge using Heroku to deploy an app using server.js.

Debugging the code provided required exploring the front-end files under the public folder and adding index.js and notes.js files under the routes folder.

Adding the bonus delete root ended up proving to be more difficult than expected due to the double .json's.

As specified in the Challenge Acceptance Criteria, the note taker achieves the following:

✨ A landing page with a link to a notes page.

✨ A page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

✨ A save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.

✨ The Save icon saves a new note, which appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

✨ Clicking on an existing note makes it appear in the right-hand column.

✨ The Write icon presents empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

✨ Bonus: The Trash icon deletes the corresponding note in the left-hand column.
